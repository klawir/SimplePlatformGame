# Please develop a simple platformer game with the following functionality:

- moving left and right
- jump
- double jump
- jump with reflection from the wall (wall jump)
- the ability to pick up an object from the ground and open the door using it.

We don't expect any animations or any special graphic elements. Simple shapes are enough.
